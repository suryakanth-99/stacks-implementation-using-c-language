# stacks-implementation-using-c-language
This is the basic program of stacks implementation in C.At first,system reads the inputs from user in order to push or pop or display etc,.
If the desired number is matched with the operations performed on stacks,they will get executed else it will exit from loop.

For example if user's input is 1,then push operation is performed and it scans immediate number to be pushed on to stack and displays set of elements present in stack.
If users input is 2,it will pop the element and displays set of elements in stack.
If user's input is 3,it displays the stack.
If users input is 4,it displays the topmost element present in stack.
If users input is 5,it displays the no of elements present in stack.
